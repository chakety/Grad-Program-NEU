# Final Project-Face Recognition Camera with LED
## Project Goal:
	For every 2 scecond, when connected camera detects a human face, the system
	will take a photo, and the green LED will shing five times. 

## Requirement:
	OpenCV: 3.0.0
	Tips: Starting from OpenCV4.0, the EigenFace Recognition may be removed from
	face library, therefore, try to install opencv_contrib.
	
	Warining: If not sure, DO NOT instal eigenface individually, since it mya cause CMAKE compile failure.
