Write an ARMv7 assembler program that sets all 16 bits of a 16-bit word in a sequential
and accumulative fashion starting from the LSB. Then, unset all 16 bits in a sequential and
accumulative fashion starting from the MSB. Print out the decimal values of the
unsigned 16-bit word on each iteration.
