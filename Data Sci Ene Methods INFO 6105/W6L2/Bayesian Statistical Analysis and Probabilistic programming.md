# Bayesian vs Frequentist Statistics
Any statistical inference scheme involves at least the following:
- Some unknown quantities, known as dependent variables.
- Some observed data, known as indenpendet varibales.
  - However, some data is actually correlated, therefore, we need to throw them away.
- One or more models that relate the independent variables to the dependent varibles via a probability distribution function. The pdf will yeild variates that essentialy statistically look like the real data.


In Bayesian, the data is fixed and model parameters are random and treated as probability distribution.

# In search of the model parameter
Suppose we are given some data and we are told that there is a process that yields this data, and which we must try to model. So we must

1. Pick the right pdf from the catalogue, and
2. Determine the right  ùúÉs for the data.
