# Method of Moments(MOM)
The mothod of moements simply assigns the empirical mean and variance to their theoretical counterparts.
- The counterpart can be read from the Histogram. 


The key is:

`alpha_mom = dp.mean()**2/dp.var()`

`beta_mon = dp.var()/dp.mean()`


# Method of Maximun Likelihood Estimation(MLE)
Estimating the paramater of a statistical model, given observation.
